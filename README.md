# PHYS 1321: Computational Methods in Physics
## Problem Set 01 - Due Sep 4, 2015
#### (Adapted from materials from Brian D'Urso)

* Fork and clone the GitHub repository for this assignment
* Complete the following problems in your forked version of this iPython Notebook and commit and create a pull request to submit.
  - I strongly encourage you to become familiar with the GitHub commit and push cycle early in the week.

Your writeup in this iPython Notebook should include:

1.  Answers to specific questions in the problem.
2.  The parameters used to generate your results.
3.  The text output of your code (use copy and paste), if it is not trivial.
4.  Images of all plots your code produces.
 - [I don't anticipate plots from this first homework but the above will be the general boilerplate for assignments.]
